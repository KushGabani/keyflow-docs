### Get started with templates

The best way to get started is by using a prebuilt template!

We've built 50+ functional workflows categorized by their use cases for you to browse, explore and learn Keyflow. You can use these to understand how things work or to run out of the box, each is built to be immediately useful

Get started with [templates here](https://www.keyflow.space/templates)

For this quickstart guide, we'll pick the <i>["Email Auto-Replier"](https://www.keyflow.space/templates/administration/email-auto-replier)</i> under the `administration` category of the templates. Simply open the template's page using the link and click on the <b>"Use Template"</b> button

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/quickstart/email-auto-replier-light.png"
    alt="Email auto-replier automation template in Keyflow"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/quickstart/email-auto-replier-dark.png"
    alt="Email auto-replier automation template in Keyflow"
  />
</Frame>

### Running a flow

You can simply run the workflow by hitting the run button in the top right corner. Running a workflow will auto-save the current version of your workflow.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/quickstart/toolbar-light.png"
    alt="Toolbar at the top-right of the canvas"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/quickstart/toolbar-dark.png"
    alt="Toolbar at the top-right of the canvas"
  />
</Frame>

After hitting run, you will see the workflow in real-time as the blocks are being executed. The outputs of each block will be displayed in the side panel after they have completed processing.

<Note>
  This template uses the Gmail integration in Keyflow, so you must connect a
  gmail account first by navigating to the [credentials
  page](https://keyflow.space/settings/credentials) and connecting your Gmail
  account
</Note>
