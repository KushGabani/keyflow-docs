## Writer Modes

The "Writer Modes" parameter in the Write to Google Sheets block allows you to specify how the data should be written to the Google Sheet. Here are the available writer modes:

1. **Add New Row**: This mode appends the provided data as a new row at the end of the specified sheet.

2. **Add New Column**: With this mode, the data is added as a new column to the specified sheet. Each element in the provided data list corresponds to a cell in the new column.

3. **Add to Specified Row**: When using this mode, you can specify a particular row index where the data should be added. The provided data will overwrite the existing data in the specified row.

4. **Add to Specified Column**: Similar to the previous mode, this mode allows you to specify a particular column index where the data should be added. The provided data will overwrite the existing data in the specified column.

Choose the appropriate writer mode based on your requirements to ensure that the data is written to the Google Sheet as desired.

## Use Cases

1. **Automate Data Entry**: Streamline the process of entering data into a Google Sheet automatically.
2. **Dynamic Reporting**: Create new sheets or update existing ones with new data programmatically for dynamic reporting.
3. **Data Organization**: Organize collected data into structured tables within Google Sheets for easy management and analysis.
4. **Real-Time Data Sharing**: Share real-time data outputs by writing to a centrally accessible Google Sheet.
