## Overview

Create a JSON object that can be used as an input for other blocks accepting JSON inputs. This block is your solution for using a hybrid approach in providing headers and body to the Call API block.

It allows creating pre-defined JSON objects, nested objects or even objects whose values depend on the output of other blocks in the flow.

## Block Inputs

| Name   | Type   | Description                                   |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `data` | object | Properties to be included in the JSON object. |

## Block Outputs

| Name   | Type   | Description                 |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `json` | object | The constructed JSON object |

## Adding properties

There are several different ways you can provide the properties for the _data_ input of the block:

1. Static - Manually set the properties of the object beforehand from the side panel.
2. Dynamic - Pass the entire object through an input handle at runtime.
3. Hybrid - Set some of properties of the object through the side panel but accept dynamic inputs from the flow at runtime.

### Method 1 - Static

Simply click on the block to open the side panel. You'll see the data section where you can click "+ Add data" to add header properties or click the "X" icon to remove the property.

### Method 3 - Hybrid

Using this approach, you can provide certain properties beforehand and accept certain properties at runtime from another block's output. Click on the block to open the side panel. Now click on "+ Add data" to add a property. You can then provide the static values as shown in Method 1 above.

To allow accepting dynamic values to the data properties, Only specify the "Key" property and leave the value as blank. You should then see a new handle called `data.YOUR_KEY_NAME` has been added automatically. You can specify the type of the property and simply connect any block's output to be used inside the object.

## Use Cases

1. **Call External APIs:** Build headers and nested body popularly required by modern APIs.
