## Overview

Evaluates a criterion against a list of cases and only executes the block in the subflow connected to that case.

## Block Inputs

| Name        | Type   | Description                                      |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `cases`     | list   | List of cases to compare against the criterion.  |
| `criterion` | string | The value to compare with each case in the list. |

## Block Outputs

The output handles are dynamically named after the cases provided in the list.

<Note>
  Only the subflow connected to the output handle corresponding to the matched
  case will be executed.
</Note>

## Use Cases

1. **Dynamic Case-based Processing:** Perform different actions based on the criterion matching specific cases.
2. **Conditional Data Routing:** Route data flow dynamically based on various case scenarios.
3. **Multi-Scenario Handling:** Handle different scenarios or conditions within a process flow by branching based on cases.
