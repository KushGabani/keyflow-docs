## Overview

Evaluates a condition and directs the order of execution based on whether the condition is met or not.

## Block Inputs

| Name              | Type     | Description                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `condition_type`  | selector | Identifies the type of filter condition to apply.                  |
| `condition`       | string   | Specifies the exact condition to be met for the filtering process. |
| `value`           | any      | The actual data to filter.                                         |
| `condition_value` | string   | The criterion against which to filter the provided value.          |

## Block Outputs

| Name      | Type | Description                                                |
| --------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `if_true` | any  | Output value provided in inputs if the condition is true.  |
| `else`    | any  | Output value provided in inputs if the condition is false. |

<Note>
  If condition provided evalues to true, only the sub flow connected to
  `if_true` will be executed. Otherwise if the condition evalutes to be false,
  only the subflow connected to `else` output handle will be executed.
</Note>

## Use Cases

1. **Conditional Data Processing:** Utilize different branches of a workflow based on varying conditions.
2. **Dynamic Routing:** Direct data flow dynamically depending on certain criteria being met.
3. **Error Handling:** Handle different error scenarios or edge cases within a process flow.
