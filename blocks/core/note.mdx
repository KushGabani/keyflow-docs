## Overview

The note block can be used to annotate your flow with comments or explainations. This is a special block that has no inputs or outputs and thus doesn't run with the flow. It's only used to add reasoning, explainations or self-notes.

It accepts any valid markdown note. Adding a note is easy as double clicking on the block to enter edit mode where you can start writing your note. The block is also resizable so you can fit your text or make it whatever size you feel appropriate.

## Use Cases

1. **Adding Comments:** Add comments or notes explaining anything you want about the flow.
