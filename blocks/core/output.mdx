## Overview

The Output block serves a specific purpose throughout the app. It accepts any input value and allows you to assign a name to it. This named output can then be used to easily view the output of the flow in user view or use the output of the flow as input for another block when using external flows.

## Block Inputs

| Name          | Type     | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output`      | any      | The value or data to be named.                                                                                          |
| `output_name` | string   | The label/name you assign to the value. If not provided, the output will still be recorded but without a specific name. |
| `output_type` | selector | The type of the value. Can be one of the following: `any` or `any[]`                                                    |

## Use Cases

1. **View flow results in user view:** An output block enables viewing the output of a flow when in user view.
2. **Complex Automations:** When using external flow blocks, the output of a flow can be passed in as inputs to other blocks.
