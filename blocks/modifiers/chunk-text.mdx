## Overview

The Chunk Text block splits a long string of text into smaller, more manageable pieces based on the specified number of characters.

## Block Inputs

| Name         | Type   | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chunk_size` | number | Specifies the number of characters for each text piece. |
| `text`       | string | The body of text to be split into smaller pieces.       |

## Block Outputs

| Name          | Type      | Description                                                      |

| `text_chunks` | string[ ] | List of text chunks, each with a specified number of characters. |

## Use Cases

1. **Conforming to external validations:** When working with limitations on text size, such as API requests that only accept a certain number of characters at a time.
2. **Text analysis:** Analyzing smaller sections can be more manageable or comparing chunks of text against each other.
