## Overview

The Filter block selectively passes through data that meets particular conditions set by the user.

It supports various condition types such as empty values, numerical comparisons, boolean states, and text-based matching conditions. The Filter block is a critical component in workflows where data needs to be vetted or cleaned, passing only the entries that fulfill the given criteria.

## Block Inputs

| Name                 | Type        | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `condition_type`     | Enumeration | Identifies the type of filter condition to apply.                                 |
| `condition`          | String      | Specifies the exact condition to be met for the filtering process.                |
| `value`              | Data        | The actual data to filter.                                                        |
| `condition_value`    | String      | The criterion against which to filter the provided value.                         |
| `output_blank_value` | Boolean     | Decides if a blank value should be output when the filtering condition isn't met. |

## Block Outputs

| Name              | Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filtered_output` | Data | The result of the filter operation. Contains either the original input value that met the filter condition, or a blank value if the condition wasn't met and 'output_blank_value' is set to true. |

## Use Cases

1. **Filtering out records:** Exclude records that do not meet certain thresholds, like age or price limits.
2. **Empty Value Handling:** Select only those rows from a dataset where a particular column is not empty.
3. **Boolean Field Subsetting:** Include only true or false values from a boolean field.
4. **String Processing:** Process only items with specific keywords, prefixes, or suffixes.
