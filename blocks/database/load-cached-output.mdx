## Overview

Retrieve previously computed output data of a block from any flow within your account using a unique identifier. This helps to by-pass long or heavy computation of a block if it has already been executed once.

The unique identifer can be copied from the block's title bar. Navigate to the run history of the flow where the already executed blocks exist. You should then see a copy button to the right of "Batch" mode checkbox. Click the copy button to copy the unique identifier to your clipboard and paste in inside the `cache_id` field of your Load Cached Output block.
